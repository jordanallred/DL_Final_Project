# Deep Learning Final Project
This is my final project submisssion for Anh Nguyen's Deep Learning course @ Auburn University. The project implements a variety of machine learning techniques 
(Convolutional Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term Memory, Random Forest Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine) to analyze and predict changes at 
incredibly small time intervals in the United States stock exchange.
